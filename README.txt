This is the Song/SongUtils package given to use by the EE 47 instructors in library form. It's still rought as I'm currently working on it, but free to use it / contribute!

To use you have to include all of the following header files in your main .ino project. I don't know why the compiler is complaining if you don't but I'm not worrying about that now...

 #include <SD.h>
 #include <EEPROM.h>
 #include <mp3.h>
 #include <mp3conf.h>
 #include <Song.h>
